Simply facial detection program in Python using OpenCV with Haar Cascades

There are two "blocks" in the program, Live Webcam detection and Still Image detection.
Each block is denoted by comments in detect.py and only one block may be uncommented and executed at a time.
Live Detection is fairly accurate with face and eye detection, but Still Image detection has room for improvement with speed and accuracy -- these issues could likely be improved by decreasing the image resolution.

To use:
Ensure webcam is connected and configured
If executing on still images, ensure image(s) is in project directory
Uncomment only desired block of code
Execute
